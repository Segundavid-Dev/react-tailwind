# This is a Project to practice my react Fundamentals skills after learning fundamentals of Tailwind and React for 1 week

### React Feactures included in this project include

- [ ] Conditional rendering
- [ ] List Rendering
- [ ] Derived state
- [ ] States
- [ ] Props
- [ ] Prop Drilling
- [ ] Conditonal styling
- [ ] State Lifting
- [ ] Early Return


_!* I hit a limitation while working with props in this project, i tried creating independency of state for my each tasks so i can handle it seperately but quickly hit a wall as i was limited with the react features i had learnt, I hope to restructure this project well enough soon after learning some other hooks to avoid using prop drilling_
